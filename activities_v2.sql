It works when we\'re moving, sitting, standing or just lying down sleeping. There\'s no stopping your heart from pumping and your lungs from expanding and contracting. It\'s easy to think we don\'t need to move at all...except we do. In fact, moving is perhaps one of the most critical mechanisms to keep your body fit and firing.</p><p><br></p><p>Our body is comprised of little cells, think of them like little bags of water and other stuff. Those bags don\'t like to sit for too long without moving, the contents becomes stale - like leaving a glass of water in a refrigerator for too long.</p><p><br></p><p>The easiest way to stop those cells getting stale is to move them. The action of moving your body causes those cells to compress and moves all the contents around.</p><p><br></p><p>The fluid in the spaces in between our cells (interstitial fluid) moves around too which helps all the little bits of crap that float around our body find their way back to the filtration system and then out.</p><p><br></p><p>Movement is critical for health. Ask anyone who\'s stuck in a bed for any length of time, they develop all sorts of conditions often unrelated to why they\'re in bed.</p><p><br></p><p>Your body wants to move, whether you feel like it or not, movement is key to survival.</p><p><br></p><p>For 200,000 years your ancestors moved a whole lot more than most of us move today. There was never a minimum exercise guideline even 50 years ago. We\'ve been moving less, eating more sugar and carbohydrates and surprise, surprise we\'ve become fat and unhealthy. Let\'s take back control, starting today.</p><p><br></p><p>NOTE: It is possible to do too much exercise, especially when just starting out, build up slowly and if you have not done any high intensity exercise for a while, ease into it. Seek advice from a health care professional if you have any pre-existing, known or suspected health condition that could be made worse by increasing exercise levels.</p><p><br></p><h2>WHY DO THIS:</h2><p>40 - 60 minutes each day has been shown to boost mental health, reduce risk of dementia, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, some cancers. It can boost mental alertness and energy levels, improve sleep, lower blood pressure, weight regulation/loss, help with digestion and gets all the contents of your bowel moving better too.</p><p><br></p><p>On to top of all that it just feels good to be out moving, maybe keeping up with your family members or dog. Being out and around others active people helps with motivation and can build healthy relationships. We could go on....just get moving.</p><p><br></p><h2>ACTION TO TAKE:</h2><p>Make your choice. Choose to move for 40 minutes each day of moderate intensity (breathing harder but can still speak). That\'s the minimum guideline for most developed countries. Aiming for 60 minutes daily is top-shelf. Break it up into small chunks to fit into your daily routine if you have to, just find 40 minutes per day.</p>', 'activity/1a68765e51588d2ac27f762c1b168d9a5ad998d6.jpeg', 32, 5, 2, 10, 1, '2022-11-02 04:37:06.968', '2022-11-02 04:38:28.363', null);
